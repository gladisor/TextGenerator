# Short abstract

In this paper we evaluate text generated by an LSTM based Language
Model. The model is trained using a text corpus mined from Leo Tolstoy's
major writings. We show that increasing the number of context words
given to the model allows it to produce text which scores similarly to
Tolstoy on readability formulas.

# Medium abstract (\<200 words)

In this paper we train Long Short-Term Memory cell based Language Models
to predict the next word in a sequence of text given a number of context
words. Language Models with the ability to predict the next word in a
sequence have a unique property of being able to generate text similar
to that which it is trained on. Number of context words given to the
models are varied to measure the effect on scores of readability
formulas and perplexity on a sample of text. Using evaluation methods on
language models which measure ability to write and read will give an
indication of the effect of supplying additional context words on the
model\'s performance. After the models are trained on a corpus of text
data mined from the novels of Leo Tolstoy, they are evaluated using both
methods. Our results show that increasing the number of context words
allows the models to generate text which achieves similar scores to
Tolstoy on readability formulas. They also show that more context
reduces average perplexity on writings of Tolstoy which are withheld
from the models during training.

# Introduction

Leo Tolstoy is considered by many to be one of the greatest Russian
authors. His work is commonly studied in High School and College
literature courses. The size and quantity of his novels creates an
opportunity for analysis with Natural Language Processing (NLP). In this
study NLP modeling techniques will be applied to a text corpus
consisting of many of Tolstoy\'s major novels. The specific modeling
techniques as well as the evaluation methods for the models will be
discussed next.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells are a type of Neural Network capable
of processing sequential information. They have been shown to preform
very well on many Language Modeling (LM) tasks including speech
recognition^1^, sentiment analysis^2^, and next word prediction^3^. When
LSTMs are used to predict the next word given a sequence of context
words, they form an autoregressive process which is able to generate new
text. Evaluation of LMs is usually done with measures such as
perplexity^4^. The formula for perplexity is shown in Equation 1.
Perplexity provides an indication of how well the LSTM-LM predicts next
words on some sample text. High values of perplexity indicate that the
LM is perplexed, and not accurately predicting the text. A shortcoming
of this method is that it lacks the ability to evaluate the readability
of generated text.

$$\text{PP}_{T}\left( p_{M} \right) = \frac{1}{{(\prod_{i = 1}^{t}{p_{M}(w_{i}|w_{1}\cdots w_{i - 1}))}}^{\frac{1}{t}}}$$

Equation : Formula for perplexity of a language model a sequence of
text. Given in Evaluation Metrics for Language Models^4^.
$\text{PP}_{T}$ is perplexity and $p_{M}$ is a language model which
takes in context words $w_{1}\cdots w_{i - 1}$and predicts the
probability of next word $w_{i}$ for sequence length $t$.

Readability Formulas (RF) are a class of simple algorithms which
calculate a score for a piece of text. The score of an RF differs for
each algorithm, as they are used to measure different qualities of the
given text such as reading ease and grade level required for reading.
Most RFs are a linear function on two components, sentence complexity
and word complexity. However, they differ in the way they measure and
weight each component. RF have been developed by the United States
Navy^5^ to create training material for enlisted personnel. And in
clinical trials^6,7^ to establish informed consent. We evaluate LSTM-LM
generated text with two widely used RF: Automated Readability Index
(ARI) and Gunning Fog Index (FOG).

The ARI formula shown in Equation 2 is used to predict the grade level
required by a reader to understand a piece of text. Unlike most other RF
it uses character level information to make a prediction. Under the ARI
formula, more difficult text contains longer words and sentences.

$$ARI = 4.71 \bullet ACW + 0.5 \bullet AWS - 21.43$$

Equation : ARI for calculating U.S grade level. ACW and AWS represent
average number of characters per word and average words per sentence.

The FOG formula Equation 3 is also used to calculate grade level;
however, the formula uses number of syllables to make a prediction. Text
with a high percentage of polysyllable words is assigned a higher grade
level under FOG.

$$FOG = 0.4 \bullet (AWS + PPW)$$

Equation : FOG for calculating U.S grade level. AWS and PPW represent
average words per sentence and percentage of polysyllable words.
Polysyllable words are defined as words with more than three syllables.

Both formulas show some similarities in how they are calculated. They
each are a linear function on two components: sentence complexity and
word complexity.

In this research, we train an LSTM-LM to predict the next word given a
variable number of context words. The training dataset is comprised of
several novels written by Tolstoy: War and Peace, Anna Karenina, What
Men Live By (and Other Tales), and The Forged Coupon (and Other
Stories). Using the writings of Tolstoy as the dataset for the model
provides two benefits. Firstly, there is a large amount of text which
can be used for training and testing our model. Secondly, we can
establish an accurate baseline value Tolstoy\'s writing style for each
RF on a validation dataset not used in training. We compare the RF
scores of the LSTM-LM generated text at a range of context words with
that of samples from Tolstoy's writings. Additionally, we evaluate the
perplexity of the LSTM-LM models on the validation dataset.

# Literature Review

In this section we review work related to our project. Specifically, we
reviewed papers related to language processing using recurrent neural
networks, word vector embeddings, and evaluation metrics.

LSTMs have been extensively used for LM. Barman and Boruah (2018)^3^
used an LSTM-LM to do phonetic transcription for the Assamese language.
Similar to our approach, their training dataset was gathered from a
novel. Their model was aimed at text completion while typing. Sak et al.
(2014)^1^ introduced a new LSTM architecture which allowed them to
preform speech recognition on a vocabulary size of 2.6 million. Their
architecture is now implemented in PyTorch­^12^.

In almost all LMs, word vector embeddings are used to provide meaningful
features to the model. This concept of using a continuous vector
representation of a word was first introduced by Hinton et al.
(1984)^8^. Methods to efficiently learn the vectors of a vocabulary of
words in a text have been proposed by Mikolov et al (2013)^9^. They
introduced the CBOW and Skip-gram algorithms that produce high quality
embeddings. They demonstrated that the embeddings can produce meaningful
results by adding or subtracting them.

Investigation of evaluation methods for Language Models has been done by
Chen et al. (1998)^4^. In their work, they show that perplexity can
accurately predict word-error rate for language models within domain
data. They introduced a new evaluation metric \"M-ref\" which is able to
outperform perplexity in predicting word-error rate on out of domain
data. Yet another evaluation metric known as Angular Embedding
Similarity was proposed by Moeed et al. (2020)^13^. This metric measures
the distance between embedded vectors. It was used to measure the
performance of Language Models in generating headline summaries of
portions of text.

# Model

Training an LSTM-LM model requires a large amount of text data. The
longest of Tolstoy\'s novels were selected for the dataset as well as
two other collections of short stories. Each of the novels selected from
Tolstoy\'s work was downloaded from an open-source repository of
literature known as Project Gutenberg^10^. Sequences of text were
extracted from the novels based on blank lines separating portions of
the text. Each sequence is split into words and punctuation, all of
which are individually referred to as tokens. These sequences sometimes
contain chapter headings and short portions of dialogue. Sequences less
than four tokens are removed in order to provide the model with useful
data. A vocabulary of 22,357 unique tokens is extracted from the
sequences. Tokens are converted to their corresponding index in the
vocabulary, and the indexes each correspond to an embedding vector^8,9^.
The total number of cleaned sequences is 19809. They are split into
(85%, 10%, 5%): train, test, and validation sequences.

In order to make a prediction of the next word our LSTM-LM needs a
number of context words (N) as input. Using seed text is a common
practice to start the text generation, however that would introduce some
bias into evaluation using RFs. The seed text itself could be removed,
but it may have influence on the rest of the generated text. Instead, we
pad the beginning of each sequence with N \"start of sequence\" (SOS)
tokens and one \"end of sequence\" (EOS) token to the end. Finally, we
split each sequence into a number of training examples equal to the
length of the sequence. Each training example is collected by taking the
N preceding words for the input, and the next word as the label, then
sliding the N preceding words over one to repeat the process. The
LSTM-LM is trained to minimize Cross Entropy Loss^11^ defined in
Equation 4. This loss function helps the model learn to make the target
next word in the sequence more likely under its probability
distribution. Once the model is trained on this dataset it is able to
generate new text with the only seed text required being the N SOS
tokens. Another benefit of padding the sequences as described is that
the total number of training examples in the dataset is the same
regardless of N. The total number of training, testing, and validation
examples are 996423, 112826, and 59188. The training set will be used to
tune the parameters of the model, the testing set will inform the
selection of hyperparameters, and the validation set will be used to
evaluate RF scores and perplexity.

$$\text{loss}(x,\ class) = - x\left\lbrack \text{class} \right\rbrack + log(\sum_{j}^{}{exp(x\lbrack j\rbrack))}$$

Equation : Cross Entropy Loss given in the PyTorch documentation. Where
$x$ represents the probability distribution produced by the LM and
$\text{class}$ represents the target next word.

The procedure to generate text with our LSTM-LM is to give it an input
sequence (for the first prediction, input will be N SOS tokens). The
model will produce a categorical probability distribution over all words
in the vocabulary from which the next word will be selected. Selecting
the next word using the most likely word produces repetitive text. By
selecting words with some stochasticity, the text becomes more
interesting. Words will continue to be added to the sequence by the
model until a final EOS token Is predicted or a maximum sequence length
of 600 is reached.

Evaluations^\*^ for RFs will be done by generating sequences from our
LSTM-LM models for each N. To ensure accurate evaluation on the RFs,
sequences will be generated until the total number of words reaches
1500. The baseline score for Tolstoy\'s text will be established by
evaluating the validation dataset with the RFs. Perplexity will be
measured for each N by averaging the models\' perplexity on each
sequence in the validation dataset.

# Results

We trained our LSTM-LM on $N = 2,\ 3,\ 4,\ 5,\ 6,\ \ and\ 7$ context
words. All runs were done with the same set of hyperparameters shown in
Table 1. Additionally, runs are compared after training for 5 epochs
using a Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060.

Figure 1: Loss and accuracy evaluated on the test dataset after each
epoch on the train dataset. Cross Entropy Loss (left) and Accuracy
(right). Each metric is evaluated at each number of context words.

Evaluation of the LSTM-LMs on the test dataset are shown in Figure 1
after each epoch. Final Cross Entropy Loss on the test dataset decreases
with each additional context word used in the model up to N = 5.
Surprisingly N = 6 and 7 show higher loss at the end of the training
process. Similar results are shown for accuracy in Figure 1 with N = 2
through 5 showing an increase in accuracy and N = 6 and 7 preforming
slightly worse. An explanation of why 6 and 7 context word models did
not perform as well could be that additional training epochs may be
necessary. Their respective loss curves have not plateaued compared to
the others. Additionally, as with all deep neural networks, more data
will always help.

supplied to the LSTM-LM models. The baseline scores for Tolstoy are
shown in orange. ARI (left) and GF (right).

After training the models, we evaluate them using the ARI and FOG tests
shown in Figure. 2. As the number of prediction words increases, we can
see that the scores on both tests approach the baseline score of
Tolstoy\'s text from the validation dataset. In the case of ARI, this
means that using more context words makes the models generate text which
contain words with more characters and longer sentences. For the FOG RF,
increasing number of prediction words results in generated text with
more polysyllable words and longer sentences. Additionally, all of the
tests in Figure B.1 provide support that an increased context words
trend towards Tolstoy\'s scores for each test.

Figure 3: Perplexity of the LSTM-LMs on the test dataset evaluated at
each number of context words.

Average sequence perplexity of the LSTM-LMs on the validation dataset
are shown in Figure. 3. For N = 2 to 5 there is a sharp drop in
perplexity, indicating that increasing number of prediction words up to
this N allows for better prediction. Similarly, to final loss and
accuracy shown in Figure 1, 6 and 7 context word models preform worse
than expected. However, N = 6 and 7 models still produce less perplexity
than N = 2 and 3.

# Conclusions

In this paper we successfully trained Language Models for next word
prediction on text written by Leo Tolstoy. The models were able to
achieve around 20% prediction accuracy on the testing dataset. We
compared the effect of giving the models different amounts of context
for it to make a prediction. Our results show that increasing the number
of context words is helpful up to a certain amount for the measures of
accuracy and perplexity. After this amount, performance decreases
slightly. One explanation for the poor results of 6 and 7 context words
is underfitting due to insufficient data. Each model was trained with
the same number of datapoints; therefore, it is logical to expect that
at a certain sequence length more data will be required for training.
With a larger amount of training data perhaps the trend of increased
performance with more context will continue. Interestingly, the results
of the readability formulas show no performance decrease with higher
number of context words. Instead, the generated text from the models
more closely matches that of Tolstoy\'s baseline in terms of sentence
and word complexity. Directions for future work that could validate the
results shown in this study could be to train the language models on
different authors. While Tolstoy scores relatively high complexity on
readability formulas, it would be interesting to see how this system
behaves for an author with lower scores.
