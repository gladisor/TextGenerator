       " 'three days after the quarrel, prince stepan arkadyevitch\\r\\noblonsky stiva, as he was called in the fashionable world woke up at\\r\\nhis usual hour, that is, at eight o’clock in the morning, not in his\\r\\nwife’s bedroom, but on the leather covered sofa in his study. he turned\\r\\nover his stout, well cared for person on the springy sofa, as though he\\r\\nwould sink into a long sleep again; he vigorously embraced the pillow\\r\\non the other side and buried his face in it; but all at once he jumped\\r\\nup, sat up on the sofa, and opened his eyes.',\n",
       " '“yes, yes, how was it now?” he thought, going over his dream. “now, how\\r\\nwas it? to be sure! alabin was giving a dinner at darmstadt; no, not\\r\\ndarmstadt, but something american. yes, but then, darmstadt was in\\r\\namerica. yes, alabin was giving a dinner on glass tables, and the\\r\\ntables sang, _il mio tesoro_ not _il mio tesoro_ though, but something\\r\\nbetter, and there were some sort of little decanters on the table, and\\r\\nthey were women, too,” he remembered.',\n",
       " 'stepan arkadyevitch’s eyes twinkled gaily, and he pondered with a\\r\\nsmile. “yes, it was nice, very nice. there was a great deal more that\\r\\nwas delightful, only there’s no putting it into words, or even\\r\\nexpressing it in one’s thoughts awake.” and noticing a gleam of light\\r\\npeeping in beside one of the serge curtains, he cheerfully dropped his\\r\\nfeet over the edge of the sofa, and felt about with them for his\\r\\nslippers, a present on his last birthday, worked for him by his wife on\\r\\ngold colored morocco. and, as he had done every day for the last nine\\r\\nyears, he stretched out his hand, without getting up, towards the place\\r\\nwhere his dressing gown always hung in his bedroom. and thereupon he\\r\\nsuddenly remembered that he was not sleeping in his wife’s room, but in\\r\\nhis study, and why: the smile vanished from his face, he knitted his\\r\\nbrows.',\n",
       " '“ah, ah, ah! oo!...” he muttered, recalling everything that had\\r\\nhappened. and again every detail of his quarrel with his wife was\\r\\npresent to his imagination, all the hopelessness of his position, and\\r\\nworst of all, his own fault.',\n",
       " '“yes, she won’t forgive me, and she can’t forgive me. and the most\\r\\nawful thing about it is that it’s all my fault all my fault, though i’m\\r\\nnot to blame. that’s the point of the whole situation,” he reflected.\\r\\n“oh, oh, oh!” he kept repeating in despair, as he remembered the\\r\\nacutely painful sensations caused him by this quarrel.',\n",
       " 'most unpleasant of all was the first minute when, on coming, happy and\\r\\ngood humored, from the theater, with a huge pear in his hand for his\\r\\nwife, he had not found his wife in the drawing room, to his surprise\\r\\nhad not found her in the study either, and saw her at last in her\\r\\nbedroom with the unlucky letter that revealed everything in her hand.',\n",
       " 'she, his dolly, forever fussing and worrying over household details,\\r\\nand limited in her ideas, as he considered, was sitting perfectly still\\r\\nwith the letter in her hand, looking at him with an expression of\\r\\nhorror, despair, and indignation.',\n",

       " 'this idiotic smile he could not forgive himself. catching sight of that\\r\\nsmile, dolly shuddered as though at physical pain, broke out with her\\r\\ncharacteristic heat into a flood of cruel words, and rushed out of the\\r\\nroom. since then she had refused to see her husband.',\n",
       " '“it’s that idiotic smile that’s to blame for it all,” thought stepan\\r\\narkadyevitch.',\n",

       " 'chapter 2',\n",
       " 'stepan arkadyevitch was a truthful man in his relations with himself.\\r\\nhe was incapable of deceiving himself and persuading himself that he\\r\\nrepented of his conduct. he could not at this date repent of the fact\\r\\nthat he, a handsome, susceptible man of thirty four, was not in love\\r\\nwith his wife, the mother of five living and two dead children, and\\r\\nonly a year younger than himself. all he repented of was that he had\\r\\nnot succeeded better in hiding it from his wife. but he felt all the\\r\\ndifficulty of his position and was sorry for his wife, his children,\\r\\nand himself. possibly he might have managed to conceal his sins better\\r\\nfrom his wife if he had anticipated that the knowledge of them would\\r\\nhave had such an effect on her. he had never clearly thought out the\\r\\nsubject, but he had vaguely conceived that his wife must long ago have\\r\\nsuspected him of being unfaithful to her, and shut her eyes to the\\r\\nfact. he had even supposed that she, a worn out woman no longer young\\r\\nor good looking, and in no way remarkable or interesting, merely a good\\r\\nmother, ought from a sense of fairness to take an indulgent view. it\\r\\nhad turned out quite the other way.',\n",
       " '“oh, it’s awful! oh dear, oh dear! awful!” stepan arkadyevitch kept\\r\\nrepeating to himself, and he could think of nothing to be done. “and\\r\\nhow well things were going up till now! how well we got on! she was\\r\\ncontented and happy in her children; i never interfered with her in\\r\\nanything; i let her manage the children and the house just as she\\r\\nliked. it’s true it’s bad _her_ having been a governess in our house.\\r\\nthat’s bad! there’s something common, vulgar, in flirting with one’s\\r\\ngoverness. but what a governess!” (he vividly recalled the roguish\\r\\nblack eyes of mlle. roland and her smile.) “but after all, while she\\r\\nwas in the house, i kept myself in hand. and the worst of it all is\\r\\nthat she’s already ... it seems as if ill luck would have it so! oh,\\r\\noh! but what, what is to be done?”',\n",
       " 'there was no solution, but that universal solution which life gives to\\r\\nall questions, even the most complex and insoluble. that answer is: one\\r\\nmust live in the needs of the day that is, forget oneself. to forget\\r\\nhimself in sleep was impossible now, at least till nighttime; he could\\r\\nnot go back now to the music sung by the decanter women; so he must\\r\\nforget himself in the dream of daily life.',\n",
       " '“then we shall see,” stepan arkadyevitch said to himself, and getting\\r\\nup he put on a gray dressing gown lined with blue silk, tied the\\r\\ntassels in a knot, and, drawing a deep breath of air into his broad,\\r\\nbare chest, he walked to the window with his usual confident step,\\r\\nturning out his feet that carried his full frame so easily. he pulled\\r\\nup the blind and rang the bell loudly. it was at once answered by the\\r\\nappearance of an old friend, his valet, matvey, carrying his clothes,\\r\\nhis boots, and a telegram. matvey was followed by the barber with all\\r\\nthe necessaries for shaving.',\n",
       " '“are there any papers from the office?” asked stepan arkadyevitch,\\r\\ntaking the telegram and seating himself at the looking glass.',\n",
       " '“on the table,” replied matvey, glancing with inquiring sympathy at his\\r\\nmaster; and, after a short pause, he added with a sly smile, “they’ve\\r\\nsent from the carriage jobbers.”',\n",
       " 'stepan arkadyevitch made no reply, he merely glanced at matvey in the\\r\\nlooking glass. in the glance, in which their eyes met in the\\r\\nlooking glass, it was clear that they understood one another. stepan\\r\\narkadyevitch’s eyes asked: “why do you tell me that? don’t you know?”',\n",
       " 'matvey put his hands in his jacket pockets, thrust out one leg, and\\r\\ngazed silently, good humoredly, with a faint smile, at his master.',\n",

       " 'stepan arkadyevitch saw matvey wanted to make a joke and attract\\r\\nattention to himself. tearing open the telegram, he read it through,\\r\\nguessing at the words, misspelt as they always are in telegrams, and\\r\\nhis face brightened.',\n",
       " '“matvey, my sister anna arkadyevna will be here tomorrow,” he said,\\r\\nchecking for a minute the sleek, plump hand of the barber, cutting a\\r\\npink path through his long, curly whiskers.',\n",
       " '“thank god!” said matvey, showing by this response that he, like his\\r\\nmaster, realized the significance of this arrival that is, that anna\\r\\narkadyevna, the sister he was so fond of, might bring about a\\r\\nreconciliation between husband and wife.',\n",
       " '“alone, or with her husband?” inquired matvey.',\n",
       " 'stepan arkadyevitch could not answer, as the barber was at work on his\\r\\nupper lip, and he raised one finger. matvey nodded at the\\r\\nlooking glass.',\n",

       " '“you want to try it on,” matvey understood, but he only said, “yes,\\r\\nsir.”',\n",
       " 'stepan arkadyevitch was already washed and combed and ready to be\\r\\ndressed, when matvey, stepping deliberately in his creaky boots, came\\r\\nback into the room with the telegram in his hand. the barber had gone.',\n",
       " '“darya alexandrovna told me to inform you that she is going away. let\\r\\nhim do that is you as he likes,” he said, laughing only with his eyes,\\r\\nand putting his hands in his pockets, he watched his master with his\\r\\nhead on one side. stepan arkadyevitch was silent a minute. then a\\r\\ngood humored and rather pitiful smile showed itself on his handsome\\r\\nface.',\n",
       " '“eh, matvey?” he said, shaking his head.',\n",

       " '“go to her, sir; own your fault again. maybe god will aid you. she is\\r\\nsuffering so, it’s sad to see her; and besides, everything in the house\\r\\nis topsy turvy. you must have pity, sir, on the children. beg her\\r\\nforgiveness, sir. there’s no help for it! one must take the\\r\\nconsequences....”',\n",

       " 'matvey was already holding up the shirt like a horse’s collar, and,\\r\\nblowing off some invisible speck, he slipped it with obvious pleasure\\r\\nover the well groomed body of his master.',\n",
       " 'chapter 3',\n",
       " 'when he was dressed, stepan arkadyevitch sprinkled some scent on\\r\\nhimself, pulled down his shirt cuffs, distributed into his pockets his\\r\\ncigarettes, pocketbook, matches, and watch with its double chain and\\r\\nseals, and shaking out his handkerchief, feeling himself clean,\\r\\nfragrant, healthy, and physically at ease, in spite of his unhappiness,\\r\\nhe walked with a slight swing on each leg into the dining room, where\\r\\ncoffee was already waiting for him, and beside the coffee, letters and\\r\\npapers from the office.',\n",
       " 'he read the letters. one was very unpleasant, from a merchant who was\\r\\nbuying a forest on his wife’s property. to sell this forest was\\r\\nabsolutely essential; but at present, until he was reconciled with his\\r\\nwife, the subject could not be discussed. the most unpleasant thing of\\r\\nall was that his pecuniary interests should in this way enter into the\\r\\nquestion of his reconciliation with his wife. and the idea that he\\r\\nmight be led on by his interests, that he might seek a reconciliation\\r\\nwith his wife on account of the sale of the forest that idea hurt him.',\n",
       " 'when he had finished his letters, stepan arkadyevitch moved the\\r\\noffice papers close to him, rapidly looked through two pieces of\\r\\nbusiness, made a few notes with a big pencil, and pushing away the\\r\\npapers, turned to his coffee. as he sipped his coffee, he opened a\\r\\nstill damp morning paper, and began reading it.',\n",
       " 'stepan arkadyevitch took in and read a liberal paper, not an extreme\\r\\none, but one advocating the views held by the majority. and in spite of\\r\\nthe fact that science, art, and politics had no special interest for\\r\\nhim, he firmly held those views on all these subjects which were held\\r\\nby the majority and by his paper, and he only changed them when the\\r\\nmajority changed them or, more strictly speaking, he did not change\\r\\nthem, but they imperceptibly changed of themselves within him.',\n",
       " 'stepan arkadyevitch had not chosen his political opinions or his views;\\r\\nthese political opinions and views had come to him of themselves, just\\r\\nas he did not choose the shapes of his hat and coat, but simply took\\r\\nthose that were being worn. and for him, living in a certain\\r\\nsociety owing to the need, ordinarily developed at years of discretion,\\r\\nfor some degree of mental activity to have views was just as\\r\\nindispensable as to have a hat. if there was a reason for his\\r\\npreferring liberal to conservative views, which were held also by many\\r\\nof his circle, it arose not from his considering liberalism more\\r\\nrational, but from its being in closer accordance with his manner of\\r\\nlife. the liberal party said that in russia everything is wrong, and\\r\\ncertainly stepan arkadyevitch had many debts and was decidedly short of\\r\\nmoney. the liberal party said that marriage is an institution quite out\\r\\nof date, and that it needs reconstruction; and family life certainly\\r\\nafforded stepan arkadyevitch little gratification, and forced him into\\r\\nlying and hypocrisy, which was so repulsive to his nature. the liberal\\r\\nparty said, or rather allowed it to be understood, that religion is\\r\\nonly a curb to keep in check the barbarous classes of the people; and\\r\\nstepan arkadyevitch could not get through even a short service without\\r\\nhis legs aching from standing up, and could never make out what was the\\r\\nobject of all the terrible and high flown language about another world\\r\\nwhen life might be so very amusing in this world. and with all this,\\r\\nstepan arkadyevitch, who liked a joke, was fond of puzzling a plain man\\r\\nby saying that if he prided himself on his origin, he ought not to stop\\r\\nat rurik and disown the first founder of his family the monkey. and so\\r\\nliberalism had become a habit of stepan arkadyevitch’s, and he liked\\r\\nhis newspaper, as he did his cigar after dinner, for the slight fog it\\r\\ndiffused in his brain. he read the leading article, in which it was\\r\\nmaintained that it was quite senseless in our day to raise an outcry\\r\\nthat radicalism was threatening to swallow up all conservative\\r\\nelements, and that the government ought to take measures to crush the\\r\\nrevolutionary hydra; that, on the contrary, “in our opinion the danger\\r\\nlies not in that fantastic revolutionary hydra, but in the obstinacy of\\r\\ntraditionalism clogging progress,” etc., etc. he read another article,\\r\\ntoo, a financial one, which alluded to bentham and mill, and dropped\\r\\nsome innuendoes reflecting on the ministry. with his characteristic\\r\\nquickwittedness he caught the drift of each innuendo, divined whence it\\r\\ncame, at whom and on what ground it was aimed, and that afforded him,\\r\\nas it always did, a certain satisfaction. but today that satisfaction\\r\\nwas embittered by matrona philimonovna’s advice and the unsatisfactory\\r\\nstate of the household. he read, too, that count beist was rumored to\\r\\nhave left for wiesbaden, and that one need have no more gray hair, and\\r\\nof the sale of a light carriage, and of a young person seeking a\\r\\nsituation; but these items of information did not give him, as usual, a\\r\\nquiet, ironical gratification. having finished the paper, a second cup\\r\\nof coffee and a roll and butter, he got up, shaking the crumbs of the\\r\\nroll off his waistcoat; and, squaring his broad chest, he smiled\\r\\njoyously: not because there was anything particularly agreeable in his\\r\\nmind the joyous smile was evoked by a good digestion.',\n",

       " 'the little girl, her father’s favorite, ran up boldly, embraced him,\\r\\nand hung laughingly on his neck, enjoying as she always did the smell\\r\\nof scent that came from his whiskers. at last the little girl kissed\\r\\nhis face, which was flushed from his stooping posture and beaming with\\r\\ntenderness, loosed her hands, and was about to run away again; but her\\r\\nfather held her back.',\n",
       " '“how is mamma?” he asked, passing his hand over his daughter’s smooth,\\r\\nsoft little neck. “good morning,” he said, smiling to the boy, who had\\r\\ncome up to greet him. he was conscious that he loved the boy less, and\\r\\nalways tried to be fair; but the boy felt it, and did not respond with\\r\\na smile to his father’s chilly smile.',\n",

       " '“yes, you see we’re growing up,” she said to him, glancing towards\\r\\nkitty, “and growing old. _tiny bear_ has grown big now!” pursued the\\r\\nfrenchwoman, laughing, and she reminded him of his joke about the three\\r\\nyoung ladies whom he had compared to the three bears in the english\\r\\nnursery tale. “do you remember that’s what you used to call them?”',\n",

       " '“surely you must be dull in the country in the winter, aren’t you?” she\\r\\nsaid.',\n",
       " '“no, i’m not dull, i am very busy,” he said, feeling that she was\\r\\nholding him in check by her composed tone, which he would not have the\\r\\nforce to break through, just as it had been at the beginning of the\\r\\nwinter.',\n",
       " '“are you going to stay in town long?” kitty questioned him.',\n",
       " '“i don’t know,” he answered, not thinking of what he was saying. the\\r\\nthought that if he were held in check by her tone of quiet friendliness\\r\\nhe would end by going back again without deciding anything came into\\r\\nhis mind, and he resolved to make a struggle against it.',\n",
       " '“how is it you don’t know?”',\n",
       " '“i don’t know. it depends upon you,” he said, and was immediately\\r\\nhorror stricken at his own words.',\n",
       " 'whether it was that she had heard his words, or that she did not want\\r\\nto hear them, she made a sort of stumble, twice struck out, and\\r\\nhurriedly skated away from him. she skated up to mlle. linon, said\\r\\nsomething to her, and went towards the pavilion where the ladies took\\r\\noff their skates.',\n",
       " '“my god! what have i done! merciful god! help me, guide me,” said\\r\\nlevin, praying inwardly, and at the same time, feeling a need of\\r\\nviolent exercise, he skated about describing inner and outer circles.',\n",

       " '“how splendid, how nice he is!” kitty was thinking at that time, as she\\r\\ncame out of the pavilion with mlle. linon, and looked towards him with\\r\\na smile of quiet affection, as though he were a favorite brother. “and\\r\\ncan it be my fault, can i have done anything wrong? they talk of\\r\\nflirtation. i know it’s not he that i love; but still i am happy with\\r\\nhim, and he’s so jolly. only, why did he say that?...” she mused.',\n",

       " '“well, shall we set off?” he asked. “i’ve been thinking about you all\\r\\nthis time, and i’m very, very glad you’ve come,” he said, looking him\\r\\nin the face with a significant air.',\n",

       " 'they were speaking of common acquaintances, keeping up the most trivial\\r\\nconversation, but to kitty it seemed that every word they said was\\r\\ndetermining their fate and hers. and strange it was that they were\\r\\nactually talking of how absurd ivan ivanovitch was with his french, and\\r\\nhow the eletsky girl might have made a better match, yet these words\\r\\nhad all the while consequence for them, and they were feeling just as\\r\\nkitty did. the whole ball, the whole world, everything seemed lost in\\r\\nfog in kitty’s soul. nothing but the stern discipline of her\\r\\nbringing up supported her and forced her to do what was expected of\\r\\nher, that is, to dance, to answer questions, to talk, even to smile.\\r\\nbut before the mazurka, when they were beginning to rearrange the\\r\\nchairs and a few couples moved out of the smaller rooms into the big\\r\\nroom, a moment of despair and horror came for kitty. she had refused\\r\\nfive partners, and now she was not dancing the mazurka. she had not\\r\\neven a hope of being asked for it, because she was so successful in\\r\\nsociety that the idea would never occur to anyone that she had remained\\r\\ndisengaged till now. she would have to tell her mother she felt ill and\\r\\ngo home, but she had not the strength to do this. she felt crushed. she\\r\\nwent to the furthest end of the little drawing room and sank into a low\\r\\nchair. her light, transparent skirts rose like a cloud about her\\r\\nslender waist; one bare, thin, soft, girlish arm, hanging listlessly,\\r\\nwas lost in the folds of her pink tunic; in the other she held her fan,\\r\\nand with rapid, short strokes fanned her burning face. but while she\\r\\nlooked like a butterfly, clinging to a blade of grass, and just about\\r\\nto open its rainbow wings for fresh flight, her heart ached with a\\r\\nhorrible despair.',\n",

(this was the money\\r\\nsergey ivanovitch had paid.) then he remembered how he had spent a\\r\\nnight in the lockup for disorderly conduct in the street. he remembered\\r\\nthe shameful proceedings he had tried to get up against his brother\\r\\nsergey ivanovitch, accusing him of not having paid him his share of his\\r\\nmother’s fortune, and the last scandal, when he had gone to a western\\r\\nprovince in an official capacity, and there had got into trouble for\\r\\nassaulting a village elder.... it was all horribly disgusting, yet to\\r\\nlevin it appeared not at all in the same disgusting light as it\\r\\ninevitably would to those who did not know nikolay, did not know all\\r\\nhis story, did not know his heart.',\n",
       " 'levin remembered that when nikolay had been in the devout stage, the\\r\\nperiod of fasts and monks and church services, when he was seeking in\\r\\nreligion a support and a curb for his passionate temperament, everyone,\\r\\nfar from encouraging him, had jeered at him, and he, too, with the\\r\\nothers. they had teased him, called him noah, and monk; and, when he\\r\\nhad broken out, no one had helped him, but everyone had turned away\\r\\nfrom him with horror and disgust.',\n",

       " 'sophie, the rosy, laughter loving, youngest princess with the mole,\\r\\nwatched him. she smiled, hid her face in her handkerchief, and remained\\r\\nwith it hidden for awhile; then looking up and seeing pierre she\\r\\nagain began to laugh. she evidently felt unable to look at him\\r\\nwithout laughing, but could not resist looking at him: so to be out of\\r\\ntemptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns. in the midst\\r\\nof the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased, they whispered\\r\\nto one another, and the old servant who was holding the count’s hand\\r\\ngot up and said something to the ladies. anna mikháylovna stepped\\r\\nforward and, stooping over the dying man, beckoned to lorrain from\\r\\nbehind her back. the french doctor held no taper; he was leaning\\r\\nagainst one of the columns in a respectful attitude implying that he,\\r\\na foreigner, in spite of all differences of faith, understood the full\\r\\nimportance of the rite now being performed and even approved of it. he\\r\\nnow approached the sick man with the noiseless step of one in full vigor\\r\\nof life, with his delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the\\r\\nhand that was free, and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected\\r\\na moment. the sick man was given something to drink, there was a\\r\\nstir around him, then the people resumed their places and the service\\r\\ncontinued. during this interval pierre noticed that prince vasíli\\r\\nleft the chair on which he had been leaning, and with an air\\r\\nwhich intimated that he knew what he was about and if others did not\\r\\nunderstand him it was so much the worse for them did not go up to the\\r\\ndying man, but passed by him, joined the eldest princess, and moved\\r\\nwith her to the side of the room where stood the high bedstead with its\\r\\nsilken hangings. on leaving the bed both prince vasíli and the princess\\r\\npassed out by a back door, but returned to their places one after the\\r\\nother before the service was concluded. pierre paid no more attention\\r\\nto this occurrence than to the rest of what went on, having made up his\\r\\nmind once for all that what he saw happening around him that evening was\\r\\nin some way essential.',\n",

       " '“catch hold of my arm or you’ll drop him!” he heard one of the\\r\\nservants say in a frightened whisper. “catch hold from underneath.\\r\\nhere!” exclaimed different voices; and the heavy breathing of the\\r\\nbearers and the shuffling of their feet grew more hurried, as if the\\r\\nweight they were carrying were too much for them.',\n",
       " 'as the bearers, among whom was anna mikháylovna, passed the young man\\r\\nhe caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the dying\\r\\nman’s high, stout, uncovered chest and powerful shoulders, raised by\\r\\nthose who were holding him under the armpits, and of his gray, curly,\\r\\nleonine head. this head, with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbones,\\r\\nits handsome, sensual mouth, and its cold, majestic expression, was\\r\\nnot disfigured by the approach of death. it was the same as pierre\\r\\nremembered it three months before, when the count had sent him to\\r\\npetersburg. but now this head was swaying helplessly with the uneven\\r\\nmovements of the bearers, and the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon\\r\\nnothing.',\n",
       " 'after a few minutes’ bustle beside the high bedstead, those who had\\r\\ncarried the sick man dispersed. anna mikháylovna touched pierre’s\\r\\nhand and said, “come.” pierre went with her to the bed on which the\\r\\nsick man had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony\\r\\njust completed. he lay with his head propped high on the pillows. his\\r\\nhands were symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt, the palms\\r\\ndownward. when pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him, but\\r\\nwith a look the significance of which could not be understood by mortal\\r\\nman. either this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes\\r\\nthey must look somewhere, or it meant too much. pierre hesitated,\\r\\nnot knowing what to do, and glanced inquiringly at his guide. anna\\r\\nmikháylovna made a hurried sign with her eyes, glancing at the sick\\r\\nman’s hand and moving her lips as if to send it a kiss. pierre,\\r\\ncarefully stretching his neck so as not to touch the quilt, followed her\\r\\nsuggestion and pressed his lips to the large boned, fleshy hand. neither\\r\\nthe hand nor a single muscle of the count’s face stirred. once more\\r\\npierre looked questioningly at anna mikháylovna to see what he was to\\r\\ndo next. anna mikháylovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stood\\r\\nbeside the bed. pierre obediently sat down, his eyes asking if he were\\r\\ndoing right. anna mikháylovna nodded approvingly. again pierre fell\\r\\ninto the naïvely symmetrical pose of an egyptian statue, evidently\\r\\ndistressed that his stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing\\r\\nhis utmost to look as small as possible. he looked at the count, who\\r\\nstill gazed at the spot where pierre’s face had been before he sat\\r\\ndown. anna mikháylovna indicated by her attitude her consciousness of\\r\\nthe pathetic importance of these last moments of meeting between the\\r\\nfather and son. this lasted about two minutes, which to pierre seemed an\\r\\nhour. suddenly the broad muscles and lines of the count’s face began\\r\\nto twitch. the twitching increased, the handsome mouth was drawn to one\\r\\nside (only now did pierre realize how near death his father was), and\\r\\nfrom that distorted mouth issued an indistinct, hoarse sound. anna\\r\\nmikháylovna looked attentively at the sick man’s eyes, trying to\\r\\nguess what he wanted; she pointed first to pierre, then to some drink,\\r\\nthen named prince vasíli in an inquiring whisper, then pointed to the\\r\\nquilt. the eyes and face of the sick man showed impatience. he made an\\r\\neffort to look at the servant who stood constantly at the head of the\\r\\nbed.',\n",

       " 'the princess glanced at her watch and, seeing that she was five minutes\\r\\nlate in starting her practice on the clavichord, went into the sitting\\r\\nroom with a look of alarm. between twelve and two o’clock, as the\\r\\nday was mapped out, the prince rested and the princess played the\\r\\nclavichord.',\n",
       " 'the gray haired valet was sitting drowsily listening to the snoring of\\r\\nthe prince, who was in his large study. from the far side of the house\\r\\nthrough the closed doors came the sound of difficult passages twenty\\r\\ntimes repeated of a sonata by dussek.',\n",
       " 'just then a closed carriage and another with a hood drove up to the\\r\\nporch. prince andrew got out of the carriage, helped his little wife to\\r\\nalight, and let her pass into the house before him. old tíkhon, wearing\\r\\na wig, put his head out of the door of the antechamber, reported in\\r\\na whisper that the prince was sleeping, and hastily closed the door.\\r\\ntíkhon knew that neither the son’s arrival nor any other unusual\\r\\nevent must be allowed to disturb the appointed order of the day. prince\\r\\nandrew apparently knew this as well as tíkhon; he looked at his watch\\r\\nas if to ascertain whether his father’s habits had changed since he\\r\\nwas at home last, and, having assured himself that they had not, he\\r\\nturned to his wife.',\n",
       " '“he will get up in twenty minutes. let us go across to mary’s\\r\\nroom,” he said.',\n",
       " 'the little princess had grown stouter during this time, but her eyes\\r\\nand her short, downy, smiling lip lifted when she began to speak just as\\r\\nmerrily and prettily as ever.',\n",
       " '“why, this is a palace!” she said to her husband, looking around\\r\\nwith the expression with which people compliment their host at a ball.\\r\\n“let’s come, quick, quick!” and with a glance round, she smiled at\\r\\ntíkhon, at her husband, and at the footman who accompanied them.',\n",
       " '“is that mary practicing? let’s go quietly and take her by\\r\\nsurprise.”',\n",
       " 'prince andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expression.',\n",
       " '“you’ve grown older, tíkhon,” he said in passing to the old man,\\r\\nwho kissed his hand.',\n",
       " 'before they reached the room from which the sounds of the clavichord\\r\\ncame, the pretty, fair haired frenchwoman, mademoiselle bourienne,\\r\\nrushed out apparently beside herself with delight.',\n",
       " '“ah! what joy for the princess!” exclaimed she: “at last! i must\\r\\nlet her know.”',\n",
       " '“no, no, please not... you are mademoiselle bourienne,” said\\r\\nthe little princess, kissing her. “i know you already through my\\r\\nsister in law’s friendship for you. she was not expecting us?”',\n",
       " 'they went up to the door of the sitting room from which came the sound\\r\\nof the oft repeated passage of the sonata. prince andrew stopped and\\r\\nmade a grimace, as if expecting something unpleasant.',\n",
       " 'the little princess entered the room. the passage broke off in the\\r\\nmiddle, a cry was heard, then princess mary’s heavy tread and the\\r\\nsound of kissing. when prince andrew went in the two princesses, who\\r\\nhad only met once before for a short time at his wedding, were in\\r\\neach other’s arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they\\r\\nhappened to touch. mademoiselle bourienne stood near them pressing her\\r\\nhand to her heart, with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready to\\r\\ncry or to laugh. prince andrew shrugged his shoulders and frowned, as\\r\\nlovers of music do when they hear a false note. the two women let go\\r\\nof one another, and then, as if afraid of being too late, seized each\\r\\nother’s hands, kissing them and pulling them away, and again began\\r\\nkissing each other on the face, and then to prince andrew’s surprise\\r\\nboth began to cry and kissed again. mademoiselle bourienne also began to\\r\\ncry. prince andrew evidently felt ill at ease, but to the two women\\r\\nit seemed quite natural that they should cry, and apparently it never\\r\\nentered their heads that it could have been otherwise at this meeting.',\n",
       " '“ah! my dear!... ah! mary!...” they suddenly exclaimed, and then\\r\\nlaughed. “i dreamed last night...” “you were not expecting\\r\\nus?...” “ah! mary, you have got thinner?...” “and you have grown\\r\\nstouter!...”',\n",
       " '“i knew the princess at once,” put in mademoiselle bourienne.',\n",
       " '“and i had no idea!...” exclaimed princess mary. “ah, andrew, i\\r\\ndid not see you.”',\n",
       " 'prince andrew and his sister, hand in hand, kissed one another, and\\r\\nhe told her she was still the same crybaby as ever. princess mary had\\r\\nturned toward her brother, and through her tears the loving, warm,\\r\\ngentle look of her large luminous eyes, very beautiful at that moment,\\r\\nrested on prince andrew’s face.',\n",
       " 'the little princess talked incessantly, her short, downy upper lip\\r\\ncontinually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary\\r\\nand drawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile of\\r\\nglittering teeth and sparkling eyes. she told of an accident they had\\r\\nhad on the spásski hill which might have been serious for her in her\\r\\ncondition, and immediately after that informed them that she had left\\r\\nall her clothes in petersburg and that heaven knew what she would have\\r\\nto dress in here; and that andrew had quite changed, and that kitty\\r\\nodýntsova had married an old man, and that there was a suitor for mary,\\r\\na real one, but that they would talk of that later. princess mary was\\r\\nstill looking silently at her brother and her beautiful eyes were full\\r\\nof love and sadness. it was plain that she was following a train of\\r\\nthought independent of her sister in law’s words. in the midst of a\\r\\ndescription of the last petersburg fete she addressed her brother:',\n",
       " '“so you are really going to the war, andrew?” she said sighing.',\n",
       " 'lise sighed too.',\n",
       " '“yes, and even tomorrow,” replied her brother.',\n",
       " '“he is leaving me here, god knows why, when he might have had\\r\\npromotion...”',\n",
       " 'princess mary did not listen to the end, but continuing her train of\\r\\nthought turned to her sister in law with a tender glance at her figure.',\n",
       " '“is it certain?” she said.',\n",
       " 'the face of the little princess changed. she sighed and said: “yes,\\r\\nquite certain. ah! it is very dreadful...”',\n",
       " 'her lip descended. she brought her face close to her sister in law’s\\r\\nand unexpectedly again began to cry.',\n",
       " '“she needs rest,” said prince andrew with a frown. “don’t you,\\r\\nlise? take her to your room and i’ll go to father. how is he? just the\\r\\nsame?”',\n",
       " '“yes, just the same. though i don’t know what your opinion will\\r\\nbe,” answered the princess joyfully.',\n",
       " '“and are the hours the same? and the walks in the avenues? and the\\r\\nlathe?” asked prince andrew with a scarcely perceptible smile which\\r\\nshowed that, in spite of all his love and respect for his father, he was\\r\\naware of his weaknesses.',\n",
       " '“the hours are the same, and the lathe, and also the mathematics and\\r\\nmy geometry lessons,” said princess mary gleefully, as if her lessons\\r\\nin geometry were among the greatest delights of her life.',\n",
       " 'when the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the old\\r\\nprince to get up, tíkhon came to call the young prince to his father.\\r\\nthe old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor of his\\r\\nson’s arrival: he gave orders to admit him to his apartments while\\r\\nhe dressed for dinner. the old prince always dressed in old fashioned\\r\\nstyle, wearing an antique coat and powdered hair; and when prince andrew\\r\\nentered his father’s dressing room (not with the contemptuous look and\\r\\nmanner he wore in drawing rooms, but with the animated face with which\\r\\nhe talked to pierre), the old man was sitting on a large leather covered\\r\\nchair, wrapped in a powdering mantle, entrusting his head to tíkhon.',\n",
       " '“ah! here’s the warrior! wants to vanquish buonaparte?” said the\\r\\nold man, shaking his powdered head as much as the tail, which tíkhon\\r\\nwas holding fast to plait, would allow.',\n",
       " '“you at least must tackle him properly, or else if he goes on like\\r\\nthis he’ll soon have us, too, for his subjects! how are you?” and he\\r\\nheld out his cheek.',\n",
       " 'the old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner. (he\\r\\nused to say that a nap “after dinner was silver before dinner,\\r\\ngolden.”) he cast happy, sidelong glances at his son from under his\\r\\nthick, bushy eyebrows. prince andrew went up and kissed his father on\\r\\nthe spot indicated to him. he made no reply on his father’s favorite\\r\\ntopic making fun of the military men of the day, and more particularly\\r\\nof bonaparte.',\n",
       " '“yes, father, i have come to you and brought my wife who is\\r\\npregnant,” said prince andrew, following every movement of his\\r\\nfather’s face with an eager and respectful look. “how is your\\r\\nhealth?”',\n",
       " '“only fools and rakes fall ill, my boy. you know me: i am busy from\\r\\nmorning till night and abstemious, so of course i am well.”',\n",
       " '“thank god,” said his son smiling.',\n",
       " '“god has nothing to do with it! well, go on,” he continued,\\r\\nreturning to his hobby; “tell me how the germans have taught you to\\r\\nfight bonaparte by this new science you call ‘strategy.’”',\n",
       " 'prince andrew smiled.',\n",
       " '“give me time to collect my wits, father,” said he, with a smile\\r\\nthat showed that his father’s foibles did not prevent his son from\\r\\nloving and honoring him. “why, i have not yet had time to settle\\r\\ndown!”',\n",
       " '“nonsense, nonsense!” cried the old man, shaking his pigtail to\\r\\nsee whether it was firmly plaited, and grasping his by the hand. “the\\r\\nhouse for your wife is ready. princess mary will take her there and\\r\\nshow her over, and they’ll talk nineteen to the dozen. that’s\\r\\ntheir woman’s way! i am glad to have her. sit down and talk. about\\r\\nmikhelson’s army i understand tolstóy’s too... a simultaneous\\r\\nexpedition.... but what’s the southern army to do? prussia is\\r\\nneutral... i know that. what about austria?” said he, rising from his\\r\\nchair and pacing up and down the room followed by tíkhon, who ran after\\r\\nhim, handing him different articles of clothing. “what of sweden? how\\r\\nwill they cross pomerania?”',\n",
       " 'prince andrew, seeing that his father insisted, began at first\\r\\nreluctantly, but gradually with more and more animation, and from habit\\r\\nchanging unconsciously from russian to french as he went on to explain\\r\\nthe plan of operation for the coming campaign. he explained how an army,\\r\\nninety thousand strong, was to threaten prussia so as to bring her out\\r\\nof her neutrality and draw her into the war; how part of that army was\\r\\nto join some swedish forces at stralsund; how two hundred and twenty\\r\\nthousand austrians, with a hundred thousand russians, were to operate in\\r\\nitaly and on the rhine; how fifty thousand russians and as many english\\r\\nwere to land at naples, and how a total force of five hundred thousand\\r\\nmen was to attack the french from different sides. the old prince did\\r\\nnot evince the least interest during this explanation, but as if he were\\r\\nnot listening to it continued to dress while walking about, and three\\r\\ntimes unexpectedly interrupted. once he stopped it by shouting: “the\\r\\nwhite one, the white one!”',\n",
